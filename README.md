# Memory Game Project

> Project made for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

*Matching game that require players to match similar elements. As the name implies, participants need to find a match of a picture on a card. For example, cards composed of 15 pairs, are face down in random order. The Player turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory.*

*For more advanced gameplay, try and beat your best time with the fewest amount of moves.*

*(the fewer the moves the more stars you get* :star: :star2: :star:*)*
